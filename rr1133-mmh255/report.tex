\section{Generate, visualize and store 2D polygonal scenes}

\subsection{Example Maps}
The density of the maps was controlled by the amount of polygons in relation to the radii. Maps with greater radii (Fig. 1) required less polygons to fill the space compared to maps with smaller radii (Fig. 2). The shape of the polygons was controlled by the number of vertices. Maps with higher number of vertices resulted in polygons that were more round in appearance (Fig. 3). Maps with a lower amount of vertices appeared more sharp (Fig. 1 and 2). The four maps generated using \textit{constructScene} and their corresponding parameters:

Rationale: Parameters were chosen accordingly for each combination of small/big and sparse/dense polygons. In other words, if we wanted to generate small and sparse polygons, we chose the parameters accordingly. Likewise, if we wanted to generate big and dense polygons, we chose the parameters accordingly.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Convex Polygon Strategy}
In order to generate convex polygons, the strategy outlined in the write up was followed.
\subsubsection{Polygon Rotation}
A randomly sampled vertex (\textit{xcenter , ycenter}) was created inside the 2mx2m map. Using this vertex as the center, the minimum radius \textit{rmin} was used to generate a circle of radius \textit{rmin}. An angle, $\theta$, is sampled from [0°,360°]. A vertex is calculated by: 
    \[x = xcenter + r*cos(\theta)\]
    \[y = ycenter + r*sin(\theta)\]
 The expressions determine where the vertice falls on the circle. This is repeated N times to get N vertices from [\textit{nmin, nmax}]. The placement of the vertices along the circumference of a circle of radius \textit{rmin} allows for the polygon to be rotated.
\subsubsection{Extrude Vertices}
To extrude a vertex, a radius \textit{r} is sampled from [0, maximum vertices - minimum vertices]. The range [0, maximum vertices - minimum vertices] allows for a vertex to lie outside of the polygon's minimum radius. It allows for the circle that the new vertex lies on to be equal to or greater than radius \textit{rmin}. The new position of the vertex is calculated by: 
    \[new x = x + r*cos(\theta)\]
    \[new y = y + r*sin(\theta)\]
This process is repeated for all the vertices in the polygon. 
\subsubsection{Convexity of Polygons}
To determine the convexity of a generated polygon, the \textit{ConvexHull} function was used. The \textit{makeConvex} function takes a polygon and applies \textit{ConvexHull} to it. The result is the indices of vertices that form a convex polygon in counterclockwise order. This is stored in \textit{hull}. The indices in \textit{hull} are used to extract the vertices of the polygon that form a convex polygon into \textit{vertices}. Another vertex, the first one, is appended to \textit{vertices} so that the polygon is closed. \textit{convexPolygons} is ordered in counterclockwise order. If the given polygon is already convex, then convexPolygons will receive the same amount of vertices as the original polygon. 

\section{2D collision checking for convex polygons}
\subsection{Implementation Details} 
To implement the collision checking approach, I used three methods. The first method was a naive method. The second and third methods were optimized methods. I implemented this collision checking approach three ways so that I could do a comparison between all implementations to see how the optimized approaches fares with respect to the overall runtime. 

\subsubsection{Naive Approach}
The naive approach I implemented was rather simplistic. The first thing I did was to check all pairs of line segments(i.e. the line segments represent the edges) between the two polygons for collisions. \newline 

To check if Line Segment A and Line Segment B intersect, I parameterized both line segments and solved for the point of intersection using Cramer's Rule. \newline 

So, for example, if a line segment went from $(1, 2)$ to $(3, 5)$, I would parameterize this line segment as $x = 1 + 2s$ and $y = 2 + 3s$. Likewise, if the second line segment went from $(5, 6)$ to $(9, 11)$, I would parameterize this line segment as $x = 5 + 4t$ and $y = 6 + 5t$. Then, I would set the $x$ parameterized equations equal to each other and, likewise, set the $y$ parameterized equations equal to each other. Hence, my system of linear equations became: \newline 

\begin{equation*}
1 + 2s = 5 + 4t
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
2 + 3s = 6 + 5t
\end{equation*}

Solving this system of equations was done using Cramer's Rule. Once I got my solution for $s$ and $t$, if such a solution existed, then I would check to see if $0 \leq s, t \leq 1$. I want to make sure the intersection points is contained within the line segments! \newline 


Once I finished checking the edges for collisions, I checked to see if any of the vertices of one polygon are inside the other. To check if a point $p$ was inside Polygon $A$, I picked a vertex of Polygon $A$, let's call this vertex $V$, and established a polar coordinate system centered about $V$. Then, I calculated the angle of each of the other vertices of $A$ with respect to $V$, essentially constructing a polar coordinate system with respect to the $V$. I made sure to go in counterclockwise order so that the polar angles I calculated would be in increasing order. This essentially splits up $A$ into "sections" in the polar coordinate system. Finally, I calculated the polar angle of the point $p$ with respect to $V$. Using binary search, since the polar angles are in increasing order, I determined which ”section” $p$ belonged to. If $p$ didn’t belong to any section, obviously it wasn’t contained in $A$. However, if $p$ did belong to any of the sections, I had to check the distance between $V$ and $p$ to make sure that it belonged within the polygon. If line segment from $V$ to $p$ didn't intersect $A$ or $p$ was on one of the edges of $A$, then I knew that $p$ was contained within $A$. Else, $p$ was not contained within $A$. 

Overall, if I had cases where there was either an intersection between one line segment from one polygon and a line segment from the other polygon or one vertex of one polygon was inside the other polygon, then I would return True to indicate that we had a collision. If I did not encounter either of these two cases, I would return False to indicate that there is NO collision.  

\subsubsection{Optimized Approach}
To implement the optimized approach, my methodology can be broken down into two major portions. Let's say we are trying to detect if Polygon P and Q collide. The first thing I did was to construct bounding boxes around each polygon. Essentially, a bounding box for a polygon is akin to drawing a rectangle around the polygon that covers all its corners \newline 

Once the bounding boxes are constructed, when checking for collision, the first thing I check to see is if the bounding boxes for P and Q intersect. If no intersection is detected, I simply return False to indicate that there is NO collision. \newline 

However, if there is a collision detected between the bounding boxes of P and Q, I need to verify this collision. To do this verification, I use the Separating Axis Theorem(SAT). \newline 

Essentially, the main principle behind the Separating Axis Theorem is as follows. If a line/axis exists such that the projections of two polygons onto this line don't overlap, then the polygons don't collide. \newline 

For each edge of both polygons, I computed the normal vector to that edge. Then, I projected each polygon onto that normal vector. If there was a gap in the projections(i.e. there was no overlap in the projections), then I could conclude that there was NO intersection between the two polygons. Else, if there was no such gap, then there was an intersection between the two polygons. 

\subsubsection{Alternative Optimized Approach}
I implemented a third optimized approach which was to use Minkowski Differences to detect collisions. Given two polygons $P$ and $Q$, they collide iff their Minkowski Difference contains the origin. \newline 

To compute the Minkowski Difference of polygons P and Q, the first thing I did was multiply the vertices of Polygon Q by $-1$ to get $-Q$. Then, I would essentially compute the Minkowski Sum of $P$ and $-Q$. \newline 

To do this, I initialized a pointer to the vertex with the lowest $y$ coordinate for $P$ and $-Q$ respectively. Then, for each edge from $P$ and $-Q$ that I was on, I would compare their polar angles(i.e. angles with respect to the horizontal, positive $x$ axis). The edge that had the lower polar angle would be added to my new polygon. I would keep iterating through this process until all edges from both polygons were added to the new polygon. Throughout this process, the pointers would simply be incremented so I could keep track of which edge I am adding to my new polygon!\newline 

Once my new polygon was computed, it represented the Minkowski Difference! Now, I just had to determine if the point $(0,0)$ was contained within this new polygon. To do this, I established a new polar coordinate system where the reference point was the first vertex in the numpy array for the new polygon. Let's call this reference point $V$. Then, I calculated the angle of each of the other vertices with respect to $V$, essentially constructing a polar coordinate system with respect to $V$.  I made sure to go in counterclockwise order so that the polar angles I calculated would be in increasing order. This essentially splits up the polygon into "sections" in the polar coordinate system. Finally, I calculated the polar angle of $(0,0)$ with respect to $V$. Using binary search, since our polar angles are in increasing order, I determined which "section" $(0,0)$ belonged to. If it didn't belong to any section, obviously it wasn't contained in the new polygon. However, if it did belong to any of the sections, I had to check the distance between $V$ and $(0,0)$ to make sure that it belonged within the polygon. If line segment from $V$ to $(0,0)$ didn't intersect the polygon or $(0,0)$ was on one of the edges of the polygon, then I knew that $(0,0)$ was contained within the polygon. Else, $(0,0)$ was not contained within the polygon.

From this table of runtime comparisons, we can observe that the Minkowski Difference algorithm performs better than the Naive Method for 7 out of 8 of the scenes. We can observe that the Bounding Box + SAT Algorithm performed better than the Naive Method for all 8 scenes. Furthermore, the Bounding Box + SAT Algorithm performed better than the Minkowski Difference for all 8 scenes.

\subsection{Plots of Free Configuration Space for Scene 1}
Note to Grader: All of the following plots of the free configuration space were generated by using the Minkowski Difference Algorithm. Although the assignment stated to use the Minkowski Sum Algorithm, an important observation to make here is that our rectangular rigid body is symmetrical. Hence, using the Minkowski Sum or Minkowski Difference Algorithm are both valid approaches to computing the free configuration space! \newline 

When visualizing the free configuration space, the red polygons represent the original polygonal obstacles in the original workspace. For each red polygonal obstacle, the surrounding green boundaries represent the representation of this obstacle in the Configuration Space.
